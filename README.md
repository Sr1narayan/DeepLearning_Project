# DeepLearning_Project
The Tumor Tracer using CNN project focuses on developing an accurate system for tumor detection and classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). By leveraging a tumor dataset sourced from Kaggle, the project trains and evaluates the CNN model on medical images that represent various types of tumors.
