# DeepLearning_Project
The Tumor Tracer using CNN project focuses on developing an accurate system for tumor detection and classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). By leveraging a tumor dataset sourced from Kaggle, the project trains and evaluates the CNN model on medical images that represent various types of tumors.
The primary objective of this project is to detect and localize tumors within medical images, enabling early detection and diagnosis. The CNN model is trained to accurately identify and classify different types of tumors, which assists in personalized treatment planning.

To ensure the reliability and effectiveness of the model, a comprehensive performance evaluation is conducted. Metrics such as accuracy and F1 score are employed to assess the model's performance. This evaluation process contributes to improved medical decision-making and enhances patient care.

By harnessing the power of deep learning and CNNs, the project provides a robust framework for tumor tracing, enabling more precise and efficient analysis of medical images. The utilization of CNNs allows for the extraction of intricate features from the images, enabling accurate tumor detection and classification.

The Tumor Tracer using CNN project is hosted on GitHub, providing a central repository for the project code, documentation, and resources. The repository serves as a valuable resource for researchers, developers, and healthcare professionals interested in leveraging CNNs for tumor analysis.
